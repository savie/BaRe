# BΛR☰ Reconstruction Status

## Baseline
- Reference: Swift Backup 5.1.0, version code 620
- Reference artifact: supplied `SwiftBackup-5.1.0-620-decompiled.zip`
- Reconstruction branch: `rewrite`
- Target: 1:1 Reference fidelity except explicitly Authorized Deviations

## Execution guard
- Supabase implementation: **WAITING FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- APK build: **WAITING FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- Current work is limited to Reference audit and GitHub reconstruction/contracts.

## Current phase
**PHASE 2 — BACKEND CONTRACT FREEZE PREPARATION**

## Latest verified Reference behavior

### Cloud backend
- `re3.c()` → current cloud tag `apps` node.
- `re3.d()` → current cloud tag `callLogBackupsCount` node.
- `re3.e(id)` → `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{id}`.
- `re3.g()` → current cloud directory under `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-current-cloud-dir}`.
- `re3.h()` → current cloud tag `folders` node.
- `re3.i()` → current cloud tag `smsBackupsCount` node.
- `re3.l()` → purchase verification Boolean node under current UID and an obfuscated child key.
- App metadata is read/written at `apps/{packageName with dots removed}`.
- App cloud backup metadata is written after Reference `prepareForFirebaseUpload()`.
- Home cloud summary reads apps, folders, SMS count and call-log count.
- FolderItem writes to `folders/{folderId}/folderItem`.
- FolderMetadata writes the complete object to `folders/{folderId}` after its cloud-write validation.
- FolderMetadata persisted shape: FolderItem + BaseBackup + Map<String, IncrementalBackup>.
- Package/cloud-directory sanitizer removes `/`, `.`, `#`, `$`, `[`, `]`.

### SMS / call-log writers
- SMS backup task writes `null` when no backups exist, otherwise integer count to `smsBackupsCount`.
- Call-log backup task writes `null` when no backups exist, otherwise integer count to `callLogBackupsCount`.
- These writer methods are now exposed in `BackupCountsRepository`.

### Billing
- `appData/activeSkus` is a Firebase list of SKU strings.
- `subs:` entries become subscription SKU values after prefix removal.
- `inapp:` entries become in-app SKU values after prefix removal.
- Other activeSku entries are ignored by the Reference billing catalog path.
- Purchase verification is a Boolean under `purchase_verifications/{uid}/{obfuscated-key}`.
- The audited graph contains the verification listener/read path; no verification-node writer was found.
- `users/{uid}/transactions/premium` is a distinct transaction object.
- Reference transaction model `wb6` fields:
  - orderId
  - packageName
  - sku
  - purchaseToken
  - signature
  - purchaseTime
  - purchaseState
  - autoRenewing
  - accountId
  - acknowledged
  - verificationTime
- Reference default transaction constructor leaves all fields null except `verificationTime=currentTimeMillis()`.
- BaRe now has `PremiumTransaction` + `PremiumTransactionRepository`.

### Contributor
- Registration read/listener: `contributorDetails/{uid-prefix}`.
- Fields: status, type, name, locales, Telegram ID, Crowdin ID, PayPal ID.
- Translator validity: name + Telegram + Crowdin.
- Community Helper validity: name + Telegram.
- No contributor mutation/write call-site found in audited Reference graph. Mutation remains UNKNOWN.

### Account / migration
- Reference `d45.c()`:
  - checks `is_migrating_to_google_sign_in`;
  - signs out Firebase auth;
  - clears anonymous identity state;
  - clears local app data for non-anonymous user;
  - resets anonymous/migration state;
  - resets cloud-restore and first-start flags;
  - cancels scheduled alarms;
  - re-runs account initialization.
- Reference Google account email-change migration compares sanitized old/new cloud directories.
- Migration is conditional: destination is checked first; source metadata must exist and pass the migration predicate.
- The metadata object is written to the new `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-new-dir}` node, then the old `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-old-dir}` node is conditionally cleaned up.
- If the source changes during cleanup, the Reference skips unsafe cleanup and attempts rollback of the destination; rollback is also conditional on the destination remaining unchanged.
- `AccountMigrationRepository.MigrationResult` now preserves these observed outcomes: `MIGRATED`, `NOT_NEEDED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `SOURCE_CHANGED`, `DESTINATION_CHANGED`, `ROLLED_BACK`, `FAILED`, `UNKNOWN`.
- Reference account initialization reads `users/{uid}/userInfo` for non-anonymous users. Anonymous users receive a local user record without a database read/write.
- Reference `userInfo` model fields are uid, anonymous, displayName, email, photoUrl, latestAppVersion, currentAppVersion; current Reference version is 620.
- Existing user profile fields are refreshed when provider identity changes, and non-anonymous userInfo is persisted back to `users/{uid}/userInfo`.
- Crashlytics UID/custom-key updates are telemetry side effects, not backend user-state contract.
- Exact provider execution remains behind repository boundaries.

### App / folder cloud cleanup
- Folder cloud deletion is explicit in Reference `al3.a(FolderMetadata)`: remove the folder metadata node first, collect base + incremental backup and manifest links, then delete those cloud files through the active cloud provider.
- App cloud cleanup is handled by Reference `ik.a(...)` / `AppBackupDeleteHelper`: it fetches `tags/{cloudTag}/apps/{packageKey}`, filters protected backups out of automatic cleanup, selects old normal backups according to the configured multiple-backup representation, and sends selected backup records to the cloud deletion operation.
- Exact app metadata-node mutation after file deletion is not fully resolved from the decompiled graph; keep this part `UNKNOWN` until the provider task payload is audited.

### Account initialization
- `d45.b()` initializes account state for registered listeners.
- When an authenticated user exists, Reference loads `userInfo` through `ah8.Companion.fromDatabase(...)` and updates telemetry identity.
- When no authenticated user exists, Reference resets first-start/cloud-restore state, cancels scheduled alarms, and signals the intro/account initialization state.
- `d45.c()` performs sign-out lifecycle cleanup and re-enters initialization via `b()`.

## Contracts added/updated in this audit batch
- `CloudAppRepository`
- `ReferenceCloudKey`
- `FolderMetadata`
- `CloudFolderRepository.writeFolderMetadata()`
- `BackupCountsRepository.writeSmsCount()`
- `BackupCountsRepository.writeCallLogCount()`
- `BillingCatalogRepository`
- `BillingSkuService`
- `PremiumTransaction`
- `PremiumTransactionRepository`
- `AccountMigrationRepository`
- `AccountLifecyclePolicy`
- `AccountMigrationRepository` migration outcome semantics

## Explicitly not executed
- No Supabase schema/table/RLS/auth implementation.
- No Supabase SDK wiring.
- No APK build.
- No install/runtime verification.
- No invented contributor mutation contract.
- No invented purchase-verification writer.

## Remaining audit before backend freeze
1. Audit the concrete cloud provider deletion payload used by app backup cleanup; keep app metadata-node post-delete mutation `UNKNOWN` until proven.
2. Audit the concrete conditional-write/delete payload helper used by Google migration; provider-neutral outcome semantics are now frozen, but the serialized payload remains provider-specific.
3. Audit remaining account initialization consumers that depend on `userInfo` and migration flags.
4. Freeze the evidence-backed backend contract after those checks.
5. Stop and request user permission before any Supabase implementation.
6. Stop and request user permission before any APK build.

## Verification rule
No parity claim from build alone. Required sequence: build → install → runtime → visual → behavior → feature → deviation audit → verification.

Do not restart the Reference inventory from zero.
