# BΛR☰ Reconstruction Status

## Baseline
- Reference: Swift Backup 5.1.0, version code 620
- Reference artifact: supplied `SwiftBackup-5.1.0-620-decompiled.zip`
- Reconstruction branch: `rewrite`
- Target: 1:1 Reference fidelity except explicitly Authorized Deviations

## Execution guard
- Supabase implementation: **WAITING FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- APK build: **WAITING FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- Current work is limited to Reference audit and GitHub reconstruction/contracts.

## Current phase
**PHASE 4 — CORE FOUNDATION + REFERENCE SKELETON RECONSTRUCTION**

## Latest verified Reference behavior

### Cloud backend
- `re3.c()` → current cloud tag `apps` node.
- `re3.d()` → current cloud tag `callLogBackupsCount` node.
- `re3.e(id)` → `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{id}`.
- `re3.g()` → current cloud directory under `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-current-cloud-dir}`.
- `re3.h()` → current cloud tag `folders` node.
- `re3.i()` → current cloud tag `smsBackupsCount` node.
- `re3.l()` → purchase verification Boolean node under current UID and an obfuscated child key.
- App metadata is read/written at `apps/{packageName with dots removed}`.
- App cloud backup metadata is written after Reference `prepareForFirebaseUpload()`.
- Home cloud summary reads apps, folders, SMS count and call-log count.
- FolderItem writes to `folders/{folderId}/folderItem`.
- FolderMetadata writes the complete object to `folders/{folderId}` after its cloud-write validation.
- FolderMetadata persisted shape: FolderItem + BaseBackup + Map<String, IncrementalBackup>.
- Package/cloud-directory sanitizer removes `/`, `.`, `#`, `$`, `[`, `]`.

### SMS / call-log writers
- SMS backup task writes `null` when no backups exist, otherwise integer count to `smsBackupsCount`.
- Call-log backup task writes `null` when no backups exist, otherwise integer count to `callLogBackupsCount`.
- These writer methods are now exposed in `BackupCountsRepository`.

### Billing
- `appData/activeSkus` is a Firebase list of SKU strings.
- `subs:` entries become subscription SKU values after prefix removal.
- `inapp:` entries become in-app SKU values after prefix removal.
- Other activeSku entries are ignored by the Reference billing catalog path.
- Purchase verification is a Boolean under `purchase_verifications/{uid}/{obfuscated-key}`.
- The audited graph contains the verification listener/read path; no verification-node writer was found.
- `users/{uid}/transactions/premium` is a distinct transaction object.
- Reference transaction model `wb6` fields:
  - orderId
  - packageName
  - sku
  - purchaseToken
  - signature
  - purchaseTime
  - purchaseState
  - autoRenewing
  - accountId
  - acknowledged
  - verificationTime
- Reference default transaction constructor leaves all fields null except `verificationTime=currentTimeMillis()`.
- BaRe now has `PremiumTransaction` + `PremiumTransactionRepository`.

### Contributor
- Registration read/listener: `contributorDetails/{uid-prefix}`.
- Fields: status, type, name, locales, Telegram ID, Crowdin ID, PayPal ID.
- Translator validity: name + Telegram + Crowdin.
- Community Helper validity: name + Telegram.
- No contributor mutation/write call-site found in audited Reference graph. Mutation remains UNKNOWN.

### Account / migration
- Reference `d45.c()`:
  - checks `is_migrating_to_google_sign_in`;
  - signs out Firebase auth;
  - clears anonymous identity state;
  - clears local app data for non-anonymous user;
  - resets anonymous/migration state;
  - resets cloud-restore and first-start flags;
  - cancels scheduled alarms;
  - re-runs account initialization.
- Reference Google account email-change migration compares sanitized old/new cloud directories.
- Migration is conditional: destination is checked first; source metadata must exist and pass the migration predicate.
- The metadata object is written to the new `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-new-dir}` node, then the old `users/{uid}/cloud_v1/{sanitized-old-dir}` node is conditionally cleaned up.
- If the source changes during cleanup, the Reference skips unsafe cleanup and attempts rollback of the destination; rollback is also conditional on the destination remaining unchanged.
- `AccountMigrationRepository.MigrationResult` now preserves these observed outcomes: `MIGRATED`, `NOT_NEEDED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `SOURCE_CHANGED`, `DESTINATION_CHANGED`, `ROLLED_BACK`, `FAILED`, `UNKNOWN`.
- Reference account initialization reads `users/{uid}/userInfo` for non-anonymous users. Anonymous users receive a local user record without a database read/write.
- Reference `userInfo` model fields are uid, anonymous, displayName, email, photoUrl, latestAppVersion, currentAppVersion; current Reference version is 620.
- Existing user profile fields are refreshed when provider identity changes, and non-anonymous userInfo is persisted back to `users/{uid}/userInfo`.
- Post-login work explicitly skips anonymous users; for non-anonymous users it reloads `userInfo` and persists the resulting Reference-shaped model.
- Anonymous → Google migration is guarded by the current identity being anonymous before setting `is_migrating_to_google_sign_in` and entering the sign-out/reinitialization lifecycle.
- BaRe now exposes the Reference `ah8` shape through `UserInfo` + `UserInfoRepository` without Firebase SDK types.
- Crashlytics UID/custom-key updates are telemetry side effects, not backend user-state contract.
- Exact provider execution remains behind repository boundaries.

### Cloud deletion provider contract
- Reference `ju3` is a Google Drive file-ID deletion task.
- Empty IDs are filtered before deletion.
- Batch deletion reports failed IDs and a provider retry delay.
- Reference retries failed IDs once; fallback delay is 5 seconds when no provider delay is available.
- Final success requires zero remaining failed IDs.
- BaRe now exposes this through `CloudFileDeletionRepository` without binding the contract to Google Drive SDK types.

### App / folder cloud cleanup
- Folder cloud deletion is explicit in Reference `al3.a(FolderMetadata)`: remove the folder metadata node first, collect base + incremental backup and manifest links, then delete those cloud files through the active cloud provider.
- App cloud cleanup is handled by Reference `ik.a(...)` / `AppBackupDeleteHelper`: it fetches `tags/{cloudTag}/apps/{packageKey}`, filters protected backups out of automatic cleanup, selects old normal backups according to the configured multiple-backup representation, and sends selected backup records to the cloud deletion operation.
- For Google Drive, the concrete file-delete provider task is `ju3`: it receives file IDs, filters empty IDs, performs batch deletion, retries failed IDs once after the provider-provided delay (or 5s fallback), and reports failure if IDs remain. The higher-level app metadata-node post-delete mutation is not fully resolved; keep that part `UNKNOWN` until the remaining task path is audited.

### Account initialization
- `d45.b()` initializes account state for registered listeners.
- When an authenticated user exists, Reference loads `userInfo` through `ah8.Companion.fromDatabase(...)` and updates telemetry identity.
- When no authenticated user exists, Reference resets first-start/cloud-restore state, cancels scheduled alarms, and signals the intro/account initialization state.
- `d45.c()` performs sign-out lifecycle cleanup and re-enters initialization via `b()`.

## Explicitly not executed
- No Supabase schema/table/RLS/auth implementation.
- No Supabase SDK wiring.
- No APK build.
- No install/runtime verification.
- No invented contributor mutation contract.
- No invented purchase-verification writer.

## Roadmap alignment
- PHASE 1 — Foundation: Android/Gradle/Java/resources/manifest baseline exists; runtime/build verification remains gated.
- PHASE 2 — Reference Skeleton: Reference Activity/Service/Receiver component boundaries are now registered in the BaRe manifest.
- PHASE 3 — UI + Navigation: Intro/Home navigation exists but remains partial visual parity; exact resource port continues.
- PHASE 4 — Core Behavior: account/schedule/cloud/messages-calls contracts are being reconstructed without Supabase.
- PHASE 5 — Features: feature-domain implementation continues after skeleton stabilization.
- PHASE 6 — Authorized Deviations: branding/premium/Supabase remain explicit deviations; Supabase is permission-gated.
- PHASE 7 — Runtime: build/install remains permission-gated.
- PHASE 8/9 — Parity/deviation audit: blocked until runtime verification is authorized and executable.

## Phase 4 progress
- Reference component skeleton now covers the audited 71 internal activities plus the 3 audited services and 8 audited receivers; these are boundaries only and intentionally contain no invented behavior.
- Placeholder Home fragment was removed; Home now maps to the four explicit Reference-shaped fragments already present.
- Reference `CallLogItem` fields and call-type constants are now represented in BaRe.
- Reference SMS default-handler persistence key and backup-file-path/highlight intent keys are represented in `MessagesCallsPolicy`.
- Capability access remains behind `MessagesCallsCapabilityRepository`; no device provider implementation has been invented.

## Open evidence boundaries after contract freeze
1. The exact provider SDK serialization behind the conditional migration transaction is provider-specific and remains outside the backend-neutral contract.
2. The app metadata-node mutation after cloud file deletion remains `UNKNOWN`; no write/delete is inferred without direct Reference evidence.
3. These `UNKNOWN` boundaries must not be silently filled during Supabase implementation.

## Execution gate after contract freeze
1. **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION:** Supabase schema/auth/RLS/SDK implementation.
2. **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION:** APK build.
3. After permission, implementation must preserve every `UNKNOWN` boundary until evidence or an explicit Authorized Deviation resolves it.

## Verification rule
No parity claim from build alone. Required sequence: build → install → runtime → visual → behavior → feature → deviation audit → verification.

Do not restart the Reference inventory from zero.
